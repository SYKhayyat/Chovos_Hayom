Layout:
    MainActivity:
There are eight buttons, arranged in a grid. On each, there is a picture of its
category, and the category name is written.
Thought has not yet been given to a floating action button, a bottom bar, a snackbar, or a taskbar.
    DashboardActivity:
        General:
There are essentially two section. The first shows the progress,
in percentage and in fraction, together with a progress bar.
The second shows the children of the category as buttons.
        Specific:
There are essentially two section. The first shows the progress,
in percentage and in fraction, together with a progress bar.
The second shows two buttons. One gives the ability (either in a popup, or in a new Activity)
to add, and the second gives the ability to reset to a user-set value.
Implementation:
    MainActivity:
Main activity holds an array containing task objects. (A task object has six fields -
name, unit name, amount learned, total, whether it is general, and an array holding children.
Another field should be added to hold a pointer to the parent.) Each button
is correlated with a task object. Clicking any button brings one to the Dashboard Activity
and sends along the task object.
    DashboardActivity:
This activity receives the task and uses its attributes to display the name and progress.
The rest of this activity depends on whether it is general or not.
If it is, a list of the children is shown. Clicking a button will send
that child as a task object to a newly inflated DashboardActivity.
If it is not general, The user will be presented with two buttons. Clicking the
buttons enables the user to add or reset the value.
Setting the value of a child will travel up, and change the value of the parent.

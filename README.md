# Chovos Hayom - An App for Serious Learners
Chovos Hayom is an app I developed as a Term Project for an Android course. It is written fully in Java and xml, and features no AI input.
The app allows you to track your progress in Torah. You can track your progress within specific mesechtos or sefarim. After saving your progress, your changes will be saved in that sefer as well as in the category containing that sefer.
It features:
* An easy way to tell where you are up to in various parts of Torah.
* A listing of siyumim.
* A calculator which determines when you will finish a mesechta or seder (or more). It can calculate based on a daily amount, with an option to have a different amount of learning on Shabbos.
Try it out! Head on over to releases, and download the apk! Feel free to reach out with issues!
